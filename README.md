# Group 4 Project 01: Pokè-Search

## Description

Our full-stack flex coding course was given a project assignment that we were put into groups to work together and complete. Our group decided to make an application in which a user searches for a Pokèmon and gets back a result page with facts about and a gif of the Pokèmon.
